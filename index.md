### About

**holomatrix** is a project for building a **holographiv display device**.

The members of this project is currently **2**. (Joining the Project Form is [closed](https://prazma.github.io/holomatrix/#About))

We are using plasma and photons, to create a device the size of a bit large and thick mobile phone.

We are in a problem with our budgets for this project. To experiment and build the test devices and OS, we will need about 5000 dollars in total to have a fixed enviroment for development. **If you are willing to support us, there is a "Donations" section where you can contribute for us.** You can also contribute to this project and help us with the OS development by forking the project repository on GitHub.

We are planning on adding touch and gesture interaction UI for this device.
